Query: What is the Virtual Safety Car (VSC) procedure?
Real Answer or information extracted from the PDF Regulation:  The VSC procedure may be initiated to neutralise a practice session, sprint session or a race upon the order of the clerk of the course. 
(a) It will normally be used when double waved yellow flags are needed on any section of track and Competitors or officials may be in danger, but the circumstances are not such as to warrant use of the safety car itself.
Predicted Answer: The Virtual Safety Car (VSC) procedure is a system used in motorsports to neutralize a practice session, sprint session, or a race upon the order of the clerk of the course. It is used when double waved yellow flags are needed on any section of the track and competitors or officials may be in danger, but the circumstances are not such as to warrant use of the safety car itself. When the VSC procedure is initiated, a message “VSC DEPLOYED” will be sent to all competitors using the official messaging system, and all FIA light panels will display “VSC”. During the VSC procedure, no car may be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically, or in a manner that could be deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person. With the exception of certain cases, no driver may overtake another car on the track while the VSC procedure is in use.

Query: What is the “ROLLING START” message?
Real Answer or information extracted from the PDF Regulation:  If, after one or more formation laps behind the safety car, the track conditions are considered unsuitable to start the sprint session or the race from a standing start, the message “ROLLING START” will be sent to all Competitors using the official messaging system, all FIA light panels will display “RS” and the car’s orange lights will be extinguished. This will be the signal to the Competitors and drivers that it will be entering the pit lane at the end of that lap. At this point the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten (10) car lengths behind it. As the safety car is approaching the pit entry the FIA light panels will be extinguished and a green flag and/or green light panel will be displayed at the Line. No driver may overtake another car on the track until he passes the Line (see Article 5.3) for the first time after the safety car has returned to the pits. The sprint session or the race will be deemed to have started when the leading car crosses the Line after the safety car has returned to the pits.
Predicted Answer: The “ROLLING START” message is sent to all competitors using the official messaging system when the track conditions are considered unsuitable to resume the sprint session or the race from a standing start. It is also used when the clerk of the course decides it is safe to call in the safety car. In a rolling start, the first car in line behind the safety car may dictate the pace and, if necessary, fall more than ten (10) car lengths behind it.
