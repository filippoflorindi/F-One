# F-One
> Automatic Text-Generation with Deep Learning Models: a Chatbot based application.


This project aims to develop a Conversational Assistant, in particular an Emotional Chatbot AI Question & Answer Text-Generation Knowledge-based, 
capable of handling conversations with users. The Chatbot is called “F-One” and is able to answer all 
questions related to the sport of Formula 1. Specifically, it is designed to provide information about the 
regulations of F1 and past as well as recent news.

  </p>

As the picture shows, the project may be divided into seven main phases:

 * [**Phase 1**: PDF Processing](#phase-1-pdf-processing)
 * [**Phase 2**: Vector Store Creation](#phase-2-vector-store-creation)
 * [**Phase 3**: LangChain Agent Development](#phase-3-langchain-agent-development)
 * [**Phase 4**: Dialogflow CX Agent Initialization](#phase-4-dialogflow-cx-agent-initialization)
 * [**Phase 5**: Flask Application Creation](#phase-5-flask-application-creation)
 * [**Phase 6**: Website Creation](#phase-6-website-creation)
 * [**Phase 7**: Response Quality Evaluation](#phase-7-response-quality-evaluation)
 
### Phase 1: PDF Processing
In this phase, I processed the PDF documents related to the Formula 1 regulations to extract relevant information. The algorithm implemented to extract the relevant text from 
the PDFs is present in [`process_pdf.py`](https://github.com/filippoflorindi/F-One/blob/main/F-One/process_pdf.py).

### Phase 2: Vector Store Creation
In this phase, I used the information extracted from the PDF documents to create a Vector Store. This store serves as a knowledge base for F-One and enables quick access to the necessary information during conversations. In the creation of the Vector Store for Formula 1 regulation information, I used the *Text_Embedding-Ada-002* model from OpenAI as embedding model and *FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)* Vector Store as system. The script that runs this part is [`vector_store.py`](https://github.com/filippoflorindi/F-One/blob/main/F-One/vector_store.py).

### Phase 3: LangChain Agent Development
This phase involved the development of the LangChain Agent. This process included implementing the Information-Retrieval system and applying the EmoRoBERTa model. The objective was to integrate these components with the *GPT-3.5-Turbo* (ChatGPT) model from OpenAI through the Prompt Engineering process using LangChain. The script that runs this part is [`langchain_agent.py`](https://github.com/filippoflorindi/F-One/blob/main/F-One/langchain_agent.py). While the script implemented for the Emotion Detection is [`emotion_detection.py`](https://github.com/filippoflorindi/F-One/blob/main/F-One/emotion_detection.py).

### Phase 4: Dialogflow CX Agent Initialization
In this phase, I initialized the Dialogflow CX Agent. This agent is responsible for managing conversations with users and coordinating the responses provided by F-One.

### Phase 5: Flask Application Creation
This phase involved creating a Flask application that integrates the LangChain Agent with the Dialogflow CX Agent through a Webhook. The script that runs this part is [`main.py`](https://github.com/filippoflorindi/F-One/blob/main/F-One/main.py).

### Phase 6: Website Creation
In this phase, I created the F-One website and subsequently made it public via GitHub Pages. The website provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with F-One and obtaining desired information about Formula 1. The folder containing the HTML and CSS scripts for the website is [`web site`](https://github.com/filippoflorindi/F-One/tree/main/web%20site).

### Phase 7: Response Quality Evaluation
Finally, in the seventh concluding phase, I conducted an evaluation of the quality of the answers provided by F-One regarding questions about Formula 1 regulations. This phase allowed to evaluate the effectiveness of the chatbot and to make possible improvements. In particular, two different aspects of F-One's responses were evaluated. The first is related to the correctness of the answers regarding the questions and the context provided. In this case, I considered the BERT Score and UniEval Factual Consistency metrics. The second aspect, relates to the correctness of the response text generated by F-One at the dialogue level. Specifically, I evaluated the following parameters using UniEval metric: naturalness, coherence, engagingness, groundedness, and understandability.
During the evaluation process, I used a test dataset, 
consisting of tuples, each comprising:
• A question about a piece of information related to 
Formula 1 regulations.
• A correct target answer/the correct context selected 
from the Formula 1 regulation PDFs.
• The response generated by F-One in relation to the 
question.
This way, it was possible to compare the answers provided by the Chatbot, for a given question with the correct ones and calculate the evaluation metrics. The dataset comprises a 
total of 30 tuples, including 10 tuples each related to the Sporting Regulation, Technical Regulation, and Financial Regulation, respectively. In the following are present the tables showing the scores that I obtained for the various parameters for the 30 tuples. The scripts that execute this part are: [`evaluation.py`](https://github.com/filippoflorindi/F-One/blob/main/F-One/evaluation.py) and [`evaluation_unieval.ipynb`](https://github.com/filippoflorindi/F-One/blob/main/F-One/evaluation_unieval.ipynb).
